# Starbucks Confidential

Welcome to Starbucks Confidential. An informational drink app that shows you the caffeine content of popular bottled Starbucks drinks that is available no where else.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Description
When my fist child was born one of the only ways I survived was through my love of coffee. My coffee consumption skyrocketed. I tried energy drinks, I tried soda, I tried tea, but coffee is really the only liquid substance I kept coming back to that is both delicious and satisfies my desire to not fall asleep while holding my newborn.

There are a variety of prepackaged coffee drinks ripe for the taking in every grocery store. I've tried many different kinds, but Starbucks seems to meet that sweet spot between quality and price. The tough thing with coffee however, is that the caffeine content is almost never available. It's not put on the cans or the packaging itself, and it's not readily available on grocer's websites.

I wanted to create an app that had this caffeine content information front and center so I could quickly compare drinks and choose one accordingly. The other two main data points I cared most about was sugar content and serving size.
